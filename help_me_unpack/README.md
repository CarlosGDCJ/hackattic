# Help me unpack
The main idea here is to know about the existence of the [struct library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#format-characters). This library contains a function that basically does everything we need to do here: `struc.unpack`. After decoding the bytes, we pass to `struc.unpack` the way to interpret the sequence of bytes as a format string and the byte sequence itself. The `<` at the start of the format string indicates the byte order to use when reading: `<`  = little endian and `>` = big endian. After defining the byte order, you use letter to represent how groups of bytes should be interpreted. e.g.: if there is an `i` in the format string, struct.unpack will interpret the next 4 bytes as an integers (you can find the full table of what each letter means [here]https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#format-characters)
